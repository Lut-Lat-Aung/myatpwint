## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login/signup with Supabase Auth, supporting multiple roles (reader, author, publisher, editor).
- **Book Marketplace:** Browse, search, and view detailed information about books.
- **My Library:** Readers can upload, store, and read their own book files (TXT, PDF, EPUB) locally.
- **Book Reader:** Advanced in-browser reading experience for TXT, PDF, and EPUB files, with support for zoom, navigation, and (planned) bookmarks and font controls.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:**
  - **Author Portal:** Submit manuscripts, track sales, and communicate with publishers.
  - **Publisher Dashboard:** Manage manuscripts, approve/reject submissions, and oversee catalog.
  - **Editor Dashboard:** (Planned) Editorial workflow and review tools.
- **Checkout & Orders:** Purchase and rent books (integration in progress).

---

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Material UI
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- **PDF Rendering:** `react-pdf` (with local PDF worker)
- **EPUB Rendering:** `epubjs`
- **State Management:** React hooks, local storage, and context

## Project Process & Milestones

### 1. Initial Setup
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript.
- Set up Supabase for authentication and database.
- Established project structure under `src/app/` for modular routing and feature separation.

### 2. Authentication & Roles
- Integrated Supabase Auth for user management.
- Implemented role-based navigation and access control (reader, author, publisher, editor).

### 3. Book Marketplace
- Built book listing, search, and detail pages.
- Connected to Supabase database for dynamic book data.

### 4. My Library & Book Reader (Current Focus)
- Created "My Library" for users to upload and read their own books.
- Supported file types: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.epub`.
- Implemented advanced PDF reading with `react-pdf` (zoom, navigation, local worker).
- Integrated `epubjs` for EPUB support (with plans for advanced features).
- Debugged and fixed PDF text layer rendering issue by importing required CSS in `layout.tsx`.

### 5. Author/Publisher/Editor Workflows
- Author portal for manuscript submission and tracking.
- Publisher dashboard for manuscript management.
- Editor dashboard planned for future editorial tools.

### 6. Checkout & Orders
- Implemented checkout flow and order confirmation (integration ongoing).

## Notable Debugging & Lessons Learned
- **PDF Text Layer Issue:**
  - Problem: PDF pages rendered twice due to missing CSS for `react-pdf` text/annotation layers.
  - Solution: Import CSS in `src/app/layout.tsx` instead of `globals.css` (per Next.js app directory requirements).
- **EPUB Library Compatibility:**
  - `react-epubjs` not compatible with React 19; switched to direct `epubjs` integration.
- **File Type Detection:**
  - Ensured robust detection and handling for `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.epub` files.

- Complete checkout and order management integration.
- Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
- Add cloud storage for user libraries (optional).
- Build out editor dashboard and workflow.
